## Working on a Team
```
Working on a team can be complex, especially if you're the team leader. You could take semesters of college classes that talk about team dynamics, organizational behavior, motivating others, etc. People have spent decades studying every aspect of leadership, much more than what we can talk about in this short course. In Pluralsight, there are some great courses that complement this course to help you become a better team leader. As with every course or topic you like, be sure to click on the related courses link. The first course I'll mention is Working on a Team. That course is for every team member. The first module is on team dynamics, including why teams are formed, the vision and goals of a team, communicating the vision and the goals. We talk about authority and power, decision making, how to handle disputes, and navigating through politics. In the second module, we talk about how to be a better team contributor, team member goals, and specific tactics to help you be a better team member. In the last module, we talk about working with difficult people. I included this module at the request of a software developer who said, "I need to understand how to work with people that I don't like." In this module, we talked about actions and reactions. We talked about assumptions and again, communication. We talked about personalities and many different types of difficult people. Speaking of personalities, my course titled, Working and Communicating with Different Personalities is in my opinion, required for team leaders. There's no way you'll have a team where everyone has the same personality or understands other personalities on the team. Mixing personalities can feel really confusing unless you understand what the personalities mean and how they drive behavior. I have to recommend my course titled, Becoming a Better Listener. Before I did that course. I hadn't really thought about active listening or the role of listening in team relationships. Team leaders who excel in their listening skills can have a real advantage over leaders whose teams don't feel they are heard. There are a lot of courses relevant to team leaders, from prioritizing tasks to time management, project management and product management, emotional intelligence and communication skills. Dig through the Pluralsight library to make a list of your own or check out the channel for team leaders I created, which you'll find in the exercise files section of this course.
