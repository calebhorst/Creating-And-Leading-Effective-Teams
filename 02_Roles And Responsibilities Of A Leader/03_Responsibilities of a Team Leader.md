## Responsibilities of a Team Leader
```
Every team member has responsibilities. I don't mean to overwhelm you, but as a team leader you have additional and special responsibilities. When you assume the role of team leader, some of these responsibilities and expectations should be explicitly stated. When you assume the role of team leader, some of these responsibilities should be explicitly stated. I've learned the more ambiguous a role is, the harder it is for teams and leaders to focus on what they really should focus on. Make sure your responsibilities are explicitly stated. I can't tell you exactly what those responsibilities will be, because every team will be different and organizational or circumstantial situations can be quite varied. Approach this part of your role as team leader with a principle‑based approach and you should be able to adjust to your responsibilities easily, even as they change. When I say principle‑based, here are some foundational principle‑driven questions you should be able to answer. What is the purpose of the team? What is the desired outcome of the team? How and when should the team be disbanded, or what does ending the team look like? What are some of the needs of my team members? How can I best help my team succeed? What are some issues I can foresee that I'll need to resolve? What are the strengths of each person on my team and how can I best utilize each person? What are characteristics of the culture I want this team to have? You should ask your boss or the stakeholders what they expect from you as a team leader. They'll likely tell you they want to achieve a certain outcome. It's important to hear this from them. I would even document what they say your responsibilities are and perhaps share your documentation in an email with them. In addition to what you learn in those conversations, I encourage you to have a conversation about your role and responsibilities with each individual on your team. Some teams are so short‑lived they might not seem significant in your career, but to people on your team, the opportunity might be career changing. Here's a list of specific responsibilities you might have as a team leader; the final outcome of the project. There are many factors that determine your team's success, but ultimately the team leader is responsible for this. Acquiring or lobbying for the right resources. Allocation of those resources. Developing the right relationships. Having the right conversations to move your projects in the right direction and managing change and helping your team and stakeholders through change. Be careful to understand what you are responsible for and what you are not responsible for. For example, while you might want all of your team members to be happy and excited, you aren't always able to control how they feel. You aren't responsible for industry shifts or market surprises, although sometimes it will be your job to be aware of outside influences that could impact your decisions. Focus on what you can, what Stephen Covey calls your circle of influence, while you're hyper aware of any information that will help you have a successful team or project.
