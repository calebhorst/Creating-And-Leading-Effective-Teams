## Expectations of a Team Leader
```
The responsibilities I listed in the responsibilities video are different than expectations. In that responsibilities should be clearly defined and agreed to, whereas expectations might be simply assumed. Fulfilling your responsibilities is of utmost importance and could impact future opportunities and performance reviews. Understanding and working on some expectations others have can be just as important and can impact how others judge your team leadership skills. When I was gathering information to put together a list of team leader expectations, I found so many different things that my list felt overwhelming. Instead of showing you a huge list of random expectations, I decided to group them into five groups. Feel free to create your own groups based on your own unique circumstances. Also, note that some of these expectations will be from your managers while others will be expectations from your team. The first set of expectations are grouped under project management. I'm not saying you are the project manager. Sometimes you'll have a project manager on your team but ultimately you're responsible for project management. In order to do this well, you might create or enforce systems to hold people accountable for their deliverables. Your team will expect that scheduling, task assignments, and resource allocation will be addressed so they can do their jobs and meet their expectations. Even if you have a project manager, you'll be expected to monitor the progress of the project in depth. Going to a meeting where you're asked about your team's progress can be embarrassing if you don't know details about the status. I grouped the next set of expectations under empowerment. You can empower your team in different ways. Perhaps you empower them when you inspire them. I know when I'm inspired, I feel empowered and when I'm empowered, I feel inspired. You can also empower through ensuring they have the education and training, as well as the right resources and tools to get their jobs done. You can empower by letting them make decisions without your approval. When team members know they have autonomy to make decisions with your support, they'll be more mindful about strategic direction and the impact their decisions might have. Another way to empower your team is to be accessible and approachable. Perhaps you demonstrate this through regular mentoring or coaching sessions. The next set of expectations is grouped under culture. As the team leader, you are responsible for developing and protecting a healthy culture. Your culture might be influenced by the team size, personalities, and what the team's objective is. Expectations that fall under culture include what, how, and when you communicate, whether to others on your team or to people outside of your team. The culture you create will be influenced by how you listen to others. Team leaders should expect to do a lot of listening. You should build a culture of trust, which means trust from you to your team and from your team back to you. In my teams, people know failure is okay. I'm not talking about failure resulting from not trying hard enough or being lazy or not caring. I'm talking about creating a culture where people know that if they try really hard and still fail, that's okay. Especially if we learn from our failure and are able to move on. Praising, rewarding, and encouraging your team members might be other important cultural expectations. The next group of expectations is related to information management. If bad intelligence comes into the group in the wrong way, you might find yourself spending time reacting to rumors and gossip or doing damage control. I think the most important point related to information expectations is for you to be honest with your team, your team will appreciate your honesty and openness, which can build trust. At the same time, you have to use discretion on what you can't or shouldn't share. Sounds contradictory, but every good manager has to figure out where that line is and respect that line. Your management will have expectations of information sharing also. This might be reporting back on KPIs and OKRs or other goals or metrics that your organization measures. I tell people who work for me that I have high expectations of regular and good communication. I like it when they come to me with reports and updates instead of feeling like I'm always chasing them down. The last group I'll talk about is leadership. If you are my team leader, I would expect you to reinforce the teams and maybe the organization's vision and mission. I expect you to maintain the team's focus and as best you can, be aware of everything that goes on in your team. You should know how your team is interacting with one another and figure out what changes or training they need. I expect my team leaders to seek input from others and when appropriate implement their input. I also expect you will make hard decisions, which is a sign of a good leader. These expectations can shift. Sometimes the urgency of some expectation will feel more important than others. Be sure the expectations you are most intent on meeting are those that are aligned with your responsibilities. You can't make everyone happy and sometimes you'll have expectations that you shouldn't have. As the team leader, you need to be able to sift through the expectations to determine which are reasonable and good expectations and which you should ignore.
