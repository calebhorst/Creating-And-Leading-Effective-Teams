## You Arenâ€™t a Participant Anymore
```
The first time I had led a team of developers, I had put the team together. I thought the dynamics of that team were normal. But having been the boss, going through the hiring process with each team member, having a big title and tenure at my company meant I was afforded some advantages I would not enjoy on subsequent teams. Fast forward a few years and I was in a different organization. Our team was pieced together from an organizational merger. Because of my previous role, I was again leading a team of developers, but this time was different. The developers from the other organization, the one we had merged with, had time and history with one another. They also had a different level of training and experience and their last manager was drastically different than I was. That was all fine. My devs and their devs quickly came together and functioned as an awesome team. But, I was in for a bit of a surprise. I quickly came to realize I wasn't a regular team member anymore. I was the boss. I was a good boss. That's the consistent feedback I heard. My team liked me and my management style, they respected me. They worked very well together. I enjoyed this team a lot. While I enjoyed knowing they were a tight team, going to lunch together and spending evenings playing board games, I came to realize I wasn't doing that with them. I wasn't invited to lunch. I didn't even know they got together after hours to play until they talked about it later. I was the boss and sometimes inviting the boss feels weird. I know that's not true everywhere in every team. I know many bosses hang out with their team and enjoy social time. I was just new enough in this role where I didn't understand what was happening. Now I understand my role as the team leader isn't to be everyone's best friend, and frankly I wouldn't have played games with them very often because I had some important after work obligations that were high priority. Still being on the outside of some of those activities felt weird to me. At times I felt lonely. I felt alone in my seemingly impossible tasks with some of the political battles I was placed in and the unrealistic expectations I had in front of me. I worked to maintain respect from my team, while sometimes protecting them from decisions and communication they really didn't need distracting them. As the team leader, sometimes you're the one making final decisions. Some of those decisions are really hard to make and might rub some of your team members the wrong way. I thought I could give a little direction to my team and then have plenty of time to do my own coding or other work. I found I spent most of my time doing team leader tasks and it put me in a position where I really got away from development. My primary role was team leader and I realized if I didn't do what I needed to, who would? My team looked up to me and depended on me spending countless hours in meetings, meetings with customers, meetings with the team, or meetings with individuals. I felt like I was in meetings all the time. Part of my job as the team leader was to sell things to my team, I might sell them on a project or the last steps of a project we're feeling burnt out on. I might sell them on a user interface or certain ways things had to be done, even changes in processes. Because I had information from customers and organizational leaders, they didn't have it, I got to communicate and sometimes convince them of changes we needed to make. Continually selling ideas to developers who are typically very smart and analytical can contribute to the feeling that you are not one of them. Perhaps the thing that most contributes to these feelings of separation from your team is when there's a major problem, perhaps personality or people issues, you're the person that everyone looks to. They don't want to soft or a fake solution. They want you to get to the root cause and fix the problem. While this can be hard, it's one of the most important things you will do to preserve your team culture, the effectiveness of your team, and their trust in you. My advice is to be personable and try to develop relationships with your team, but realize that you are the boss and because of that you aren't buddies with everyone the way you might be if you weren't the boss. Getting too close to people can cause problems when you have to make changes or discipline them. At the same time, remember that in a few years you might be working under one of the people on your team. Change is inevitable, and I've found your professional relationships can last a lot longer than a particular role.
