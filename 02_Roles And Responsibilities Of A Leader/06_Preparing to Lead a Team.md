## Preparing to Lead a Team
```
Years ago, I had the opportunity to lead a team of youth in a leadership simulation. I was new to this type of activity and felt inadequate to have the role I had. I remember going to two orientation meetings and then showing up the morning of the event. My peers had done a lot of preparation, but I honestly didn't know how I could have prepared. So after two orientations, I basically jumped in with both feet ready to learn as we went. Sometimes you'll have opportunities to lead teams that are put together very quickly, without giving you much time to prepare. In those situations, you'll find everything you've done up to that point, your education, previous roles, previous leadership experiences, mentoring, and examples from other leaders, will contribute to your leadership. You may feel ill prepared, but really all your experiences will have been part of your preparation. With that in mind, I'll share a dozen skills or characteristics you can work on now for when your leadership opportunity comes up. Really, this is just my list. You should come up with your own list. You can spend years, decades working on these skills. If you're already a team leader, I encourage you to be intentional about each skill on your own list and make time to learn more about and practice them. First, team leaders need organizational skills. Your team will expect you to quote unquote, be on top of things. If you're disorganized, miss meetings and deadlines, and don't follow through on your commitments, they'll lose trust in you. If you need help with organization, consider bringing someone on that can help you be more organized. Second, you'll need someone on your team who is good at scheduling and you need to understand the fundamentals of scheduling. Poor scheduling practices can have a great impact on your team and their morale. If you have ambiguity or people who are over scheduled, you'll have a frustrated team. This seems like a pretty simple, straightforward skill, but it can easily be messed up. Third, you should be proficient in estimating project completion. As a team leader, you'll need to report up and down on where projects are at. Estimating project or phase completion wrong, whether overly optimistic or too conservative, can have an impact on the next stages. It can also create a lack of trust from those you are giving estimates to, causing them to wonder if you really know what's going on. Fourth, you should have a basic understanding of strategy and the strategy of your organization, and how your team fits into that strategy. Understanding strategy can help you make better decisions when your team is faced with big challenges. It can help you know what and when to communicate to others. Sometimes being a team leader will feel like you are playing chess against a very savvy opponents. Fifth, a strong team leader is skilled in bringing out the best from each team member. Bringing out the best in each person comes from recognizing, understanding, and respecting the strengths each person brings and helping each person contribute according to those strengths. Not only does this help each person bring their optimal value to the team, it helps them feel appreciated and valued, which is something you definitely want. Sixth, practicing diplomacy or being tactful can help you become a more effective team leader. I'm reminded of a mantra from an old boss who regularly repeated that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. This is someone who had to make hard decisions that would impact people's lives. Even in the hardest decisions I saw him work through, he was a model of diplomacy. I'm still working on this one. Seventh, every team leader should have enhanced communication skills. Identify where you have opportunities to improve in written and verbal communication and work on those skills. You should have plenty of opportunities to work on your communication. I found that when we have a leadership role, we have to be extra careful with what and how we communicate. Eighth, you need to learn how to effectively influence others. You will likely have plenty of opportunities to influence people on your team, customers, your managers, and others. You can be heavy handed and use your authority as the team leader, which is definitely one way to influence. That's not my style. Let me recommend the classic book, "How to Win Friends and Influence People." Ninth, I strongly encourage you to learn about quality control or quality assurance. Dr. Deming made an entire career and changed the manufacturing industry by focusing on quality control principles. As the team leader, you are responsible for the outcome of your team and you can't say, Well the people in charge of QA failed. Tenth, you should learn the ins and outs of reporting. Kevin Miller has an excellent course here on Pluralsight about metrics and reporting for managers. Check out that course to come up to speed on what you should be thinking about, as well as get access to worksheets you can use right now. Reports and reporting can seem tedious, but reporting can be the difference between your team's success or failure. Eleventh, as the team leader, you should have ample opportunity to make presentations to other people in a boardroom setting. This is a powerful skill. If you're uncomfortable making presentations to groups, I encourage you to look at some of the presentation courses in the Pluralsight library, and one of the best ways to improve is to practice. Do more group presentations. Twelfth, you should become skilled in leading meetings. Don't be the team leader who is known for having boring, useless, ineffective meetings. Learn how to run and lead meetings effectively and even how to avoid having meetings. Pay attention to starting and ending times, make sure you have an agenda, and the main points were actually discussed or resolved. Know how to recover from a sidetracked meeting. One of the best ways to learn how to run better meetings is to pay attention in the meetings you attend that others run. What can you learn from them? What things should you do or not do to have better meetings? There you go, a dozen skills you could work on to be a better team leader. Of course there are many courses in Pluralsight that can help with these and other skills. None of these will be perfected overnight. But as you purposefully work on these skills, your effectiveness as a team leader should increase and you should see the results manifested in how your team acts, reacts, and performs. One last bit of advice, don't worry about working on all of these at once. Pick one or two skills and focus on improving those. Once you feel comfortable with those, add another skill. Improving your soft skills is really more of a marathon than a sprint.
