## The Five Stages of a Teamâ€™s Life Cycle
```
Understanding the five stages of a team's lifecycle can help you understand your team's dynamics and why the dynamics might change. This is much studied and taught about in organizational behavior classes, which means there are plenty of books, articles, and other resources that go deeper into the concept of the stages of a team lifecycle than what I'll cover. If you understand the dynamics of your team during each of the five stages, you'll be better prepared to influence, persuade, communicate, and motivate your team. Let's talk about each of the five stages. I remember learning about these in college thinking the definitions and approach were too academic and clinical. As I've spent time in different organizations and industries and on a variety of teams, I've learned that these stages really play out and are important to understand. The first stage of a new team is called forming, that is forming or creating the team, this is an exciting time. People are excited to be on the team, they've tied up loose ends from their other projects and are ready to contribute to this team. In the forming stage, you're kind of in a honeymoon phase, people are optimistic, they want to be there, and they want to contribute. During this stage you can lay a good foundation that will impact the other stages. Make sure you let your team members really get to know one another. This could happen during offsite meetings or through meetings where people get to learn from or about one another. Let your team know what the purpose and expectations are, timelines, and any important systems or processes. This is a great time to share your vision. The next stage in the team development lifecycle is called storming. When you get to the storming stage, the excitement has begun to wear off and people are experiencing frustration. They might feel like they aren't getting enough information or don't have the right resources. Perhaps they realize the specs don't make sense or change too often. Quirks from their colleagues are apparent. The storming stage can feel chaotic. During the storming stage, you want to make sure you clarify roles and expectations and regularly revisit the vision. The team leader should try to resolve conflict and differences quickly. The next stage is called the norming stage. This is when people start to settle into their work. They understand the vision, their roles, and expectations. There's less frustration than when the team was storming. Researchers say during this stage, the team leader tends to focus on the project and not do as much with individuals on the team. I think this might happen because of the fatigue of navigating the previous stage. They say coaching, mentoring, and communicating tend to decrease. Watch out for this and make sure you give individual team members the time and attention they need. After the norming stage, you will move into the performing stage. This is where the team is functioning at a very high level and things seem to be going very well. As with the norming stage, you'll want to continue to be attentive to your team members needs and concerns. The project will seem to be progressing nicely, but you still need to communicate, inspire, train, and fulfill other roles your team expects from you as their leader. The last stage may sometimes be ignored, but it is inevitable. This is the adjourning stage, which is how the team finishes. It's important you prepare for and pay special attention to this stage. People naturally worry about what's next in their career and where they might go. If the project was successful, they might see some fun opportunities. If the project was not successful, they might be concerned about their options. Change is hard for all of us. As a team leader, you are in the position where you can help each individual have a smooth transition to whatever is next. Those are the five stages of the team lifecycle They are natural and inevitable. How long you spend in each stage depends on various factors, but you can imagine each stage will have an impact on how your team operates and how you should lead your team.

## Notes
- Understanding the five stages of a team's lifecycle can aid in comprehending team dynamics and changes.
- The five stages are: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning.
- Forming: A time of excitement and optimism, where team members are eager to contribute, laying the foundation and sharing the vision is crucial.
- Storming: Frustration sets in as team members encounter challenges, conflicts, and issues, necessitating role clarification and conflict resolution.
- Norming: People settle into their roles and understand the vision, with reduced frustration, although team leaders should continue to support individual team members.
- Performing: The team functions at a high level, but team leaders must still fulfill their roles in communication, inspiration, training, and more.
