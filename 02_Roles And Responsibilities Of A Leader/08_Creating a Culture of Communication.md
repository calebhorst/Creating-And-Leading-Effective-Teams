## Creating a Culture of Communication
```
When I put my teams together or when I first hire someone, one of the most important conversations I have is about communication. My main message is that of all the things I expect from them, communication is number one. Of course, I expect them to be competent in their job and hopefully I've done a good job assessing their abilities. I expect them to not be jerks and to add to the team culture. Again, this is on me and my ability to assess their fit before I extend them an opportunity. When they come on, I emphasize how important communication is to me. In my teams, I work hard to create a culture where communication is easy, expected, and rewarded. I talk about how I have brought people onto my team to bring their best ideas and work. I expect them to perform at a high level. I recognize that they'll have ideas that are different than, even contradictory to my ideas. I'm okay with that. It's important for each person to understand that I know I don't have all the answers and I brought them on to expand our abilities. I need them to communicate their ideas, I need them to push back on our direction and how we do things. Sometimes you get someone who is afraid to speak up because they are the new person or because they are worried about saying something contradictory to the boss. This can be seen where there are cultural differences. People from some cultures have been taught to not be contradictory or to offer ideas against what the boss has said. Sometimes you see this when someone is coming from a toxic work environment and they don't want to disrupt the power structure. I beg my team to disrupt. I have seen too many good ideas from different people to discount them. Now, whether we adopt their ideas or not, that's another thing, but we certainly welcome them. We discuss them and we value them. I should say, I've worked with people who have taken years to really come into this way of thinking, but I continually work with them and train them to be more open. I'm not talking about creating a contentious work environment. I once worked with a manager who said that, "In Good to Great," the landmark book on company success, author Jim Collins wrote, "Great companies had hard conversations." The manager cited Jim Collins while defending his contentious, argumentative nature. He was a bully and used this principle to defend his bullying. I'm not saying that at all. I think this communication needs to be given with and received with respect. Respectful communication is part of my team culture, but I don't want someone to think, "I'm too new" or "I'm not the boss" or "They've been here longer than I have" and not bring good, strong, or the right ideas to the table. The other communication expectation I bring up up front and continue talking about as appropriate, is my expectation to be kept current on things. I learned this when I was a developer and then managed developers. Here's an analogy, let's say a customer wants a programming project. The customer sits down with a product manager or developer or whoever and they go through the specs. This is a massive project, let's say it takes a year to finish. The dev team comes back to the customer after a year and says, "Here it is, we're done. Here's our invoice." The customer looks at the final product and is confused. The final product looks nothing like what she asked for or thought she asked for. This scenario has played out across the globe for decades. And it is happening today because we aren't communicating enough. Of course, nowadays we have systems or processes in place to help avoid this type of outcome. The agile methodology should help prevent this from ever happening because there is constant communication and checking in. Going back to a culture of communication, I want you to check in with me. Need time off? Check in with me! Can't make it in or need to change your work hours this week? Check in with me! Stuck on your projects? Let me know! I'm not a micromanager. My team will attest to that. But my baseline assumption is that you are doing well and making progress. If you have needs, whether that's information, resources, adjustments to expectations or deadlines, whatever your needs are, communicate. I'll check in with you but I need you to know that even though I might seem busy to you, I want, I crave this type of communication. Doing this creates a culture of communication. You need to honor what you commit yourself to and reward or incentivize your team when they communicate well. I'm not saying you have to give bonuses or cash, just recognizing their communication, ideas, and contributions could be the reward and incentive they need.
