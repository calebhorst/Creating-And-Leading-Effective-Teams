## Buying into Your Leadership Role
```
I think I've always been excited to be a leader. I think I've had good ideas, good people skills, and could manage and motivate a group to success. In my earlier leadership roles, though, the excitement tended to wear off when difficult situations came up or when I would have to make difficult decisions that could impact individuals or the success of the team. Imposter syndrome would sink in and I'd question if I was the right person for the job. Self‑doubt and imposter syndrome are real issues that many leaders face. I have lived through it, I've coached leaders through it, and I've watched from the sidelines as leaders have tried to work through their own self‑doubt. I have a few thoughts to share with you for when these thoughts and feelings creep in. In my most impactful imposter syndrome experience, I had to remind myself that I had gone through the interview process and I beat out the other candidates. I also had to remember that while I might not have been the perfect candidate, I was the one the decision makers chose. They knew I'd have to go through a learning curve. Good managers recognize most people aren't performing at 100% right away and allow that learning curve process to happen. Depending on the role, I have told some of my recent hires that I expect them to take a good three or 12 months to work through the learning curve. I also tell them they will likely experience imposter syndrome and then talk about why I hired them and to let those feelings of self‑doubt go their way and not dwell on them. Are you ready to be the team leader? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you still have things to learn and improve upon. But let me tell you, every leader out there has had things they need to work on. Everyone can improve, learn, and practice. Don't let your insecurities convince you that you aren't the right person for the job. As long as you're willing to learn, try, and improve, you should be okay. When you think you know it all and there's not room for improvement or you just don't care to try anymore, that's when it might be time to give someone else the opportunity. Leading others can be challenging. It can feel uncomfortable and stretch you in ways you didn't think you are ready to be stretched. Your ego and weakness can be on display. It can also be a wonderful opportunity to impact people and help them realize some of their own greatness. You can have a huge impact on their futures, on your organization, customers, and maybe even the industry. If you're nervous, that's okay. If you have self doubts, that's okay. Give yourself the room and flexibility to work through the learning curve and imposter syndrome. You might not have the exact qualifications to be the best team leader now, but being willing to learn and grow might be more important. Make sure you figure out how much of this to communicate with your boss. Too much might make you sound whiny and insecure, too little and you might deprive them of providing the help and guidance they should provide as your boss.
