## Creating the Team Foundation
```
As the team leader, it's critical you lay the foundation and communicate expectations right away. You can't assume everyone will already know what the team's foundational principles will be. This is your opportunity to start to define and work towards a team culture. You could have a meeting to talk about your team goals, vision, or objective. I've seen some leaders declare each of these giving definition and direction to their team. I've seen other leaders open this conversation up with a brainstorming session, with the idea that if the team comes up with foundational principles, they have more buyâ€‘in and will respect what they come up with more than if the foundation were just handed to them. There's a great Harvard Business Review article that breaks down the early stages of forming a team with three important objectives. In the exercise files, you'll find a link to the article I reference. The first objective is to establish group norms. Norms might look like rules, you might consider them boundaries of how people act and how things are done. In the past, I've come up with my own list of norms that are important to me, shared that list with my new team, and asked what additions or modifications they would make. Because of everyone's experiences in good and bad teams, they'll usually bring great ideas to help refine your list and create a list of norms for your new team. It's critical that everyone knows what the team's norms are, which means you should probably communicate them up front and for the duration of the team. Norms aren't necessarily rules, but they can influence rules. Think of norms more as guidelines or this is how our team works. For example, a group norm might be that each person is empowered to make certain decisions on their own, without getting approval. Another group norm might be how the team communicates. For example, decisions made by one person should be documented in the task management system with an explanation of the decision and justification why the decision was made. These two norms might sound like extra work or bureaucracy, but what they do is ensure each person can make a certain level of decisions while maintaining a high level of communication in a central place. Norms let people know how your team functions and what the expectations and roles are. You can define norms for communication, conflict resolution, anything that will help your team know what they can do to be successful. The second objective from this article was to establish clear goals. Just as you as the team leader needs to understand the goals and objectives of the team, your team needs to know what they are working towards. Establishing clear goals will help your team know what the team's success will be. Clearly established goals will help everyone know how they will be evaluated. You should let people know what you expect of them and how you will measure their performance. Your priorities as the team leader should be aligned with the team goals and objectives. When there isn't a question about these goals, everyone can confidently work towards the same thing. The third objective is to create the right environment. The right environment could mean helping everyone feel comfortable and motivated to contribute. Here are three ideas to create this type of environment. First, show appreciation when team members share an idea. A lot of people feel nervous about sharing ideas. We're worried about sounding dumb. When you show genuine appreciation, you create an environment where ideas are actually welcome. Some of us have worked on teams where ideas weren't welcome and just this simple gesture helps you create the right environment. Second, teach your team to respect silence in meetings. I was at a treat where the facilitator was giving instructions for a brainstorm session we were about to have, he was establishing team norms. He said the silence during a brainstorming session was okay, it was good, it was healthy. He said people generally feel uncomfortable with silence and feel an urge to fill in the silence, even when they don't have anything meaningful to add. When we respect silence, he said, and allow it to have a place in our meetings our results would be better. And they were better. I've thought about that and shared this in my brainstorming sessions for years. This is an example of creating the right environment. Third, when you introduce people on your team to one another, recognize the skills and talents they bring to the table. This helps everyone get to know one another, and it shows you are aware of, watching, and appreciative of what people do. This shows your team how much you care about them and value their contributions. The ideas presented in this article to create norms, establish clear goals, and nurture this type of environment will help you create a strong foundation for your team.

## Notes
- As a team leader, it's crucial to establish a strong foundation and communicate expectations from the beginning.
- Consider having a meeting to discuss team goals, vision, or objectives to define and work towards a team culture.
- An article in Harvard Business Review suggests three important objectives when forming a team:
  1. Establish group norms, which are guidelines or rules that dictate how the team operates.
  2. Set clear goals to help the team understand what they are working towards and how success will be measured.
  3. Create the right environment where team members feel comfortable and motivated to contribute.
- Group norms help shape team behavior and expectations, covering areas like communication, conflict resolution, and decision-making.
- Clear goals align the team's efforts and help evaluate individual and team performance.
- Creating the right environment involves showing appreciation for ideas, respecting silence in meetings, and recognizing and appreciating the skills and talents of team members.
- These strategies help create a strong foundation for your team and foster a positive team culture.
