## Getting Off to a Good Start
```
Think of the first few interactions with your team as the first impression. They say you can never have a second first impression. What can you do to have the right first impression and get your team off to a good start? Before you implement any tactics to get off to a good start, write down what your goals are as a team leader. Your goals might be to have a group that gets along and brings the best out of one another. You might want to create a team culture and emphasize the value and importance of each person on the team. You might want to build confidence around the probability of success of the team or confidence in the team you have built. You want to emphasize loyalty or create a culture where failure is okay, as long as you learn from failed attempts. Your written goals will help you come up with the best tactics at this stage. Here are some specific ideas to consider. Do get‑to‑know‑you activities so the team can learn more about one another. This might be a meeting where everyone shares a few factoids about themselves, such as their background, aspirations, and hobbies or passions. Or, in one of your first meetings you can have two or three people do that, like an employee spotlight. This can help people really feel like they are part of the team. Do trust building exercises when you plan these, consider the makeup of your team and the culture you want to create. As Stephen Covey says, "Begin with the end in mind." Know why you are doing these exercises. If your team is particularly adventurous, maybe you do something really crazy. The level of crazy depends on what you're after and considers what each person would be okay with. Something like this would be exceptionally crazy, but people who do this would talk about it for years. Whether you do something like this mud run or you do the trust fall where someone stands on a chair or a table and falls back for the rest of the team to catch them, respect each individual's boundaries. I have some fear of heights issues that probably came from falling through a roof when I was a kid and I would not like to do the trust fall. From the beginning, when you communicate the team goals, talk about any type of rewards or incentive system you can put in place. There are some great ways to reward and incentivize people that don't have to do with adding to your budget. Although, if you can get an incentives budget that could be meaningful. Your reward system could include peer and manager recognition, access to special parking, even days off. Talk with your leadership, and even your team, to find out what kinds of incentives you could put in place. This doesn't have to be overly formal, but you want to be strategic about this and offer meaningful incentives. Whatever systems and processes you start with realize you may have to tweak them as time goes on or you may have to abandon them. If you are in a team that moves quickly and the goals or targets are subject to change, you'll need to be flexible. Doing things like these intentionally will help you establish a strong team environment and culture. The key is to know your goals and make sure each activity you put in place is aligned with those goals.
