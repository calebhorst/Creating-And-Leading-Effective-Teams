## Success Metrics
```
When you understand the purpose of your team, you can develop a set of metrics to help you ensure you're on track. Neglecting key metrics can mean your team is exceptionally busy and may be doing great things, but they might not be making progress on the team's defined objectives. That can actually be okay. Especially if the stated objective should be redefined based on changing circumstances. If that happens, the success metrics should be adjusted. There are three common success metrics I hear about. They are sometimes used interchangeably but they really are different. They are KPIs, which stands for key performance indicators. KSFs, which are key success factors. And OKRs, which are objectives and key results. While each of these are different, your organization might use them differently than other organizations. I don't care as much what you call them as how you use them. It's critical that you don't overcomplicate things. Whether your team is big or small, whether you plan to be together for two weeks or two years, the more complicated your metrics systems are, the more likely they will fail. In Kevin Miller's course, Managing IT: Metrics and Measurements, he says that every metric has a cost. The more things you measure, the more costly your metric system will be. That cost could be in time to gather, process, analyze, or even consume your metrics. More than the cost, though, complex systems have a way of being cast aside. People need to focus on their jobs and know a handful of metrics, not go through pages and pages of criteria or data. Unless, of course, their job is to go through pages and pages of criteria or data. Back to your KPIs, OKRs, and KSFs, they each have a different purpose. Study them and determine what you really need to measure. Figure out, perhaps with your team, what measurements you could and should keep track of and how you will keep track of them. If something is too hard to measure, and knowing the measurement gives you a nominal benefit, perhaps discard it. I'd rather focus on a handful of key metrics than track, say, a hundred things we could track. Kevin's course on metrics and measurements goes deeper on what you could and should measure, so be sure to check that out. I work on a few web projects and some of the metrics my team measures include, data we get from our web analytics. I'm mostly interested in visitors in a time period. Number of upgrades, number of shopping cart abandons, user complaints or bug reports, especially looking for consistently reported issues, and number of leads. As a team leader, I'm keeping track of new sales and expenses. I want to tie our activity, including UX changes and marketing work into new sales. These are the things that might cause me to lose sleep. Just a handful of things that are important to me, nothing overwhelming or hard to keep track of. I can tie everything I focus on back to those things. Can you deduce my goals based on what I'm measuring? I want to see increased revenue that is profitable and sustainable. As with other ideas, I've talked about, make sure your metrics tie back to your objectives. Aligning your metrics to your objectives can help you align your tasks and work, which should help you develop an efficient and effective team.

## Notes
- Understanding your team's purpose allows you to develop relevant metrics to track progress.
- Neglecting key metrics can lead to busyness without progress towards defined objectives.
- Common success metrics include KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), KSFs (Key Success Factors), and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).
- The complexity of your metric system should be kept in check to prevent it from becoming overwhelming and costly.
- Each metric type serves a different purpose, so study them and determine what is essential to measure for your team.
- Focus on a handful of key metrics that align with your objectives and discard ones that are too difficult to measure or offer nominal benefits.
- Metrics should tie back to your team's objectives, helping you align tasks and work to achieve efficiency and effectiveness.
- The speaker's example metrics include web analytics data, sales, expenses, and revenue, which align with their goal of increased profitable and sustainable revenue.
- Ensure your metrics are aligned with your team's objectives to drive efficient and effective team performance.
