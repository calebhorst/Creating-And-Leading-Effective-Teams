## Reinforcing Communication
```
In all of my courses, I talk about communication. Communication is key to personal and professional relationships. The better we communicate, the better we understand and can influence others. Communication is not the easiest thing we do. We should constantly work to improve our communication. I think a team leader who consistently communicates well, teaches their team to trust them and in turn communicate well. One of the most important aspects of communication is that even though we say or write something once, we'll likely have to repeat it more than we think we should. This makes me think of talking to a two or three year old who continually asks, why? I'm not saying your team is like a two or three year old baby, but while it might be frustrating, repeating your message can be a critical part of your effective communication. Here's an example of when this is critical. Let's say in the first meeting with your team, you present the team's goals and your vision, this is an exciting time and your team feels how excited you are. They're excited and can't wait to get to work. A couple months later, after not having repeated your goals or vision, your team is stressed and you can feel people checking out. They aren't bringing their ideas or their excitement like they did early on. It's easy for a team to lose momentum when they focus on routine tasks without remembering why they are doing things. Contrast that to a team that has routine tasks, but they are constantly reminded of the vision. The vision is something much bigger than a task. For example, at my company, Jibber Jobber, we help people during their job search. My team can get caught up in the tedium of DevOps, fixing bugs, updating the interface, or doing customer support, and coming to work will just be a job. But as we talk about the people we are impacting, the person who just lost their job and is scared thinking about their future or the person who has been using our system for months and is now facing eviction, we become more empathetic. We don't think about fixing this thing because it's one of hundreds of things in our task management system. We think about what we do so Julie can have a more delightful experience. You can't communicate that just once and hope it sticks. The why is something you should communicate regularly. Other things you might communicate regularly include the team mission, the team objectives, what success looks like, and how individual roles contribute to the team's success. For example, people who interface with customers, internal or external, are collecting customer feedback regularly, but that feedback might never make it to the dev team, the ops team, or the QA team. You should facilitate that communication and help those teams who don't interface with customers understand the bigger why and who their work is impacting. Now that we've established what you consistently communicate, I want to talk about how to do it. When you communicate for reinforcement of ideas, you need to be clear. You can't be ambiguous, especially early on when people need to clearly understand what you are saying. You don't want people to come back weeks or months later and say, Oh, I think I understand what you were trying to say. If you hear that you weren't clear enough. Clarity comes when you remove jargon, cliché, even sarcasm and misleading humor from your messaging. Expect the words and phrases you choose to use as the team leader to be repeated by your team internally and externally. Some words will be misunderstood by people outside of your team. For example, your customers and stakeholders. When you use words and phrases your customers and stakeholders use and normalize that in your team instead of using internal jargon, you'll reinforce good language and reduce confusion. I've been in many meetings where people ask for clarification about a project or a status or an issue because internal jargon is used, and not everyone at the meeting knows the jargon. You may choose to adopt the customer's jargon. The goal is better understanding by everyone. To reinforce your messages, post them in a central location and then refer back to that post. Expect to repeat your message again and again and be okay with that. I'd rather my team asked me for clarity multiple times rather than wrongly assume something. You can repeat the same phrase or message multiple times, maybe in a team meeting, and then in a group email, and then to someone in your office. Try not to get frustrated at having to repeat the same message over and over. I consider it a good thing when people ask me to clarify something, even if it's something I feel like I've repeated 20 times before. I can polish my message and understand where I've been unclear and communicate better next time. Your goal with this type of communication is to reinforce your mission and vision and the importance of each person's contributions.
