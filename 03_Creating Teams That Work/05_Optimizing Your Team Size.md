## Optimizing Your Team Size
```
Have you thought about the best size for your team? If your team is too small, people feel overworked or you don't have the specialists needed for complex projects. If your team is too big, you have people that don't have work to do and you might create a culture of not getting things done. But what is the right team size to meet your objectives? There's a tendency to think about projects in a number of hours needed to complete. Let's say you have an estimated 500 hours needed to complete your project. Based on the deadline, which is 2.5 weeks from the time you start, you figure each person will work about 100 hours, which means you need five people on your team. Five people times 100 hours equals the 500 hours I need to finish this project, right? Well, what if I had 10 people? If I had 10 people on the project, I could get it done in half the time. That's pretty cool. But wait, this simple math can be deceiving. In 1975, the first edition of "The Mythical Man‑month" was published. The author, Fred Brooks, proposed that adding more people actually makes software projects take longer. Why would that be? Before we go into that question, here are three quotes attributed to Fred Brooks. "What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months." "Nine people can't make a baby in a month." "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." These statements are funny and I can imagine you can see the truth or wisdom in each of them. I've experienced the impact of adding more people to a project. Hey, if we give you two more people, can you get this done faster? Um, well, now we're back at that simple math problem of 500 hours, but we're not appreciating the impact of what adding two more people means. Adding more people beyond what you need adds more management complexity. You're adding more personalities to the mix and ideas of how to do things. You can't add another person without impacting your team culture. I'm not saying these changes and impacts will all be negative, but they will change things. As the team leader, you need to assess how appropriate the size of your team is. If your lead contributors are justifiably feeling too stressed and could use help getting work done, you get to assess what kind of stress that is and whether adding more people or moving deadlines would be a better option. If you find people are distracted and distracting others, perhaps you have too many people on your team. It's part of your job to assess your resources and make or request changes as appropriate. I was working on a project where we went from one developer to two developers. I didn't think much of it. We just add another person and bring them up to speed, right? I was in for a surprise, adding the second developer added a lot of complexity. We had to change how we released and QA'd code, how we communicated about project statuses and changes, as well as how we worked with QA, the project manager, and our customer interface. We had to figure out who was responsible for what, which meant who wasn't responsible for other things. When we added another person, we multiplied the complexity of our team. Of course, that forced us to put systems and processes in place that made it a lot easier to add a third or fourth developer. People talk about an optimal team size of being between 3‑7 people and if your team is much bigger than that, you'll probably see smaller teams form within your big team. Maybe as the leader, you let these sub teams organically form or you explicitly define the sub teams. Here are issues to consider when it comes to finding your optimal team size. First, beware of unnecessary politics and red tape, which can happen at any team size but gets worse as a team gets bigger. Imagine the rules and processes a team of a hundred developers need that a team of 2 or 3 don't need. Keep a close eye on how rules and processes evolve. Having too many or having too much strictness can be stifling and frustrating. Second, beware of communication challenges. As your team grows, potential for miscommunication and confusion can increase. People don't get the information they need in a timely manner or they get too much information and they can't go through it all. As you see communication issues come up, you'll need to address them head on and maybe consider changing the size of your team. Third, larger teams have their own problems. People are less productive or are not responsible for their work. When people don't have ownership of issues or input into direction, it's easy to kind of take a back seat. Contrast that to a team of 2 or 3 where it's harder to not be responsible or take ownership. Your team size might need to change as your project and requirements change. Perhaps you start small and grow as needed or you start with a full team, but move a few people off your team when their contributions are done. Don't think you need to end with the same size you started with. Just remember, as you transition people off your team, do it with dignity and appreciation. Some people might feel like getting released from the team before others is an indication of their work or your confidence in them, which might not be the case at all.

## Notes
- Team size is crucial and should align with project requirements and objectives.
- A team that's too small can lead to overwork and lack of specialized skills, while a team that's too big can result in inefficiency and reduced productivity.
- Adding more people to a project doesn't always mean it will be completed faster; it can increase management complexity and change team dynamics.
- Assess the appropriateness of your team's size based on stress levels, distractions, and overall effectiveness.
- Beware of unnecessary politics, red tape, and communication challenges that can arise as a team grows.
- Larger teams may face productivity and ownership issues.
- Team size may need to change based on project requirements, and it's essential to handle transitions with dignity and appreciation.
- Optimal team size is often considered to be between 3-7 people, and sub-teams may form within larger teams to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
