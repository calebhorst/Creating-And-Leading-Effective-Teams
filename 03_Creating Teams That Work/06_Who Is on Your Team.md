## Who Is on Your Team
```
One of my favorite parts of "Good to Great", the book by Jim Collins, is where he talks about making sure you get the right people on the bus. That is, your company or your team is the bus, and you want to make sure you have the right people. He talks about even getting the right people on the bus, even if you don't have a specific role for them yet. That isn't realistic for a lot of us building small, temporary teams, but it's still a great idea if you can afford it. In a perfect world, we would be able to choose who is on our own team. However, sometimes we inherit a team or parts of a team and the team members are new to us. Maybe we wouldn't have chosen them, if we had a choice. I was involved in an organizational merger where people I hired were put on an existing team. Fortunately everyone on the team was great and we fit together really well, but that isn't always the case. I've seen teams where someone was put on because they were the boss's kid or because they were getting moved out of another team where they weren't a good fit and they had to go somewhere. This can work or it can really disrupt what you are trying to build. When I build teams, I have a few considerations. The first and most important is technical competency. I don't need the very best, the fabled 10x programmer, but I do need people who can actually do the job. You need to understand the technical requirements of tasks you have, whether that's development, or QA, or project management, or whatever, and bring people on your team who can do the job with little to no training in the craft you're hiring them for. Although you will need to train them for any organization or team nuances. Just be careful to not exclude someone who would be a great fit and could learn the job in an acceptable timeframe, even if they can't perform right away. My second consideration is the culture fit. I know some people disagree with the idea of a culture fit. There's pretty intense conversation that people only want to work with people like them, which means there isn't much diversity of thought or experience on a team. I know there are problems with this idea of culture fit, but we still need to hire people who we think we would like to work with or at least get along with. I do my technical competency, or proficiency analysis, pretty early on. If I need a developer with a certain amount of experience, I will only consider developers with at least that amount of experience. Then, I can stack up each developer I want to learn more about based on their skills and proficiencies. This is where the preâ€‘interview communication comes in, as well as the interviews. I might ask for some clarification about technical proficiencies, but mostly I focus on a conversation that helps me understand what the person is like, how they think, how they have solved problems in the past, or other things that help me get to know them. The way I do it, technical proficiency is a given to get on my short list and culture fit is the factor that likely sways me to bringing you on my team. My third consideration is an assessment of extra value they could bring to the team. That might be a deep understanding of the industry or important industry connections they could tap into. Perhaps they are excellent with soft skills and since you already hired a few people who are really lacking those soft skills, their soft skills would be a great addition to round out the team and help accomplish the team's objectives. One thing to note, there might be someone who is the right person for my team, is highly competent, but isn't exactly the best culture fit. There are reasons I'll bring that person on anyway, as long as they aren't toxic. My objective isn't to have everyone be best friends, it's to get the job done. But I stay away from toxic people.

## Notes
- Hiring the right people for your team is crucial for success.
- In some cases, you may inherit team members or be limited by organizational decisions when building your team.
- Key considerations when building a team include technical competency, culture fit, and extra value they can bring to the team.
- Technical competency is essential for the role, and candidates should be able to perform the job with minimal training.
- Culture fit involves assessing whether candidates are likely to work well with the existing team and align with the organization's values and culture.
- Pre-interview communication and interviews help evaluate candidates' skills and proficiencies.
- Assessing extra value may include industry knowledge, connections, or soft skills that complement the team's needs.
- While culture fit is essential, it's possible to hire someone with strong technical skills, even if they don't perfectly fit the team culture, as long as they are not toxic.
