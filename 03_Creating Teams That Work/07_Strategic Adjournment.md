## Strategic Adjournment
```
Years ago I was talking with a lawyer about a business contract we were reviewing, I remember something profound he taught me. Contracts are critical to help each party know how to terminate the relationship. Up to that point, I hadn't thought about going into a business relationship with the intent to end it. In my na√Øve mind, I probably thought you would get into great relationships and stay in them forever, but the wisdom of defining what an ideal ending looks like is something we can all learn from. In Stephen Covey's book, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," he says the second habit is to begin with the end in mind. If you want to be a successful team leader, you need to seriously think about the end or, as we talked about in the five stages of the team, the fifth stage, adjourning. I said this is something we overlook, but I want you to be more intentional about adjourning instead of letting it haphazardly happen. Adjourning an awesome team can be like ending an awesome book. I have found myself reading the last few pages of a book I've really enjoyed slowly, almost hesitant to read the last sentence. I didn't want it to end. People on your team might feel the same way. You might have been the best leader for them or they might have the best coworkers or their contributions might have made a huge impact on others or they finally felt recognized and appreciated. Of course, others might be ready for a change, but for some people adjourning your team might be a real shock, especially if your team ends sooner than expected. I think just about everyone is wired to be adverse to change. Change brings so much stress to most of us. Early in my career, I worked at a company that moved the entire office to another city across the state. I don't think management understood how hard that was going to be and how many people they would lose by making that change. This wasn't changing somebody from one seat to another, which can be stressful enough for some people, these were big changes that would impact just about every aspect of their life. When you think about the end of your team, think about the acronym WIIFM. WIIFM stands for what's in it for me? This is what people on your team are thinking. What will happen to them? Do they need to look for a new job? Do they even want to go back to their old team? As you keep their needs and concerns in mind, you'll be able to think through the adjourning stage in a way that will help them, and helping people through this stage is the opposite of burning bridges. Helping others transition to whatever is next will help you have a strong professional network for years to come. One of the most powerful end of team or end of project tactics I've ever seen was called a debrief. The debrief allows you to sit down and say, "Okay, we just took a part in something that was really big and really impactful. Let's talk about it." Sometimes we talk about the operations, the logistics, things that happened and things people said, we talk about the team and team dynamics, we talk about what worked, what didn't work, and what we learned. A debrief is a great way of getting closure on a particular project, which helps everyone transition to whatever's next for them. If this sounds like a postmortem, there are similarities, but I found a postmortem is more about what went wrong and how do we do this better next time, where a debrief is a lot more open. The objective might be to just talk about what happened and what we can learn, but not necessarily fix a system or process. As the team leader, you should help people understand what their options are. You should write letters of recommendation for your team members, consider writing LinkedIn recommendations. I've heard of team leaders who make introductions for people who were on their team. These simple gestures can be so meaningful to people who have respected you as their leader. These are things you could encourage other team members to do. If you've created a strong positive team culture, they'll be anxious to help one another. They'll be excited to stay in touch professionally. Just because your team and projects end doesn't mean your relationships end. The professional relationships you have worked with could be important to each of you for decades to come.

## Notes
- Contracts are essential for defining the terms of a business relationship, including how it may end.
- Stephen Covey's "Begin with the end in mind" principle applies to team leadership, particularly when considering the fifth stage, adjourning.
- The adjourning stage is often overlooked but should be approached intentionally to help team members transition effectively.
- Consider the WIIFM (What's in it for me?) perspective of team members when thinking about the end of the team.
- A debrief is a powerful tactic for closing a project, allowing the team to discuss operations, logistics, team dynamics, successes, failures, and lessons learned.
- Provide support to team members by helping them understand their options, writing letters of recommendation, and making introductions in their professional network.
- Encourage a strong positive team culture that fosters ongoing professional relationships beyond the project's end.
