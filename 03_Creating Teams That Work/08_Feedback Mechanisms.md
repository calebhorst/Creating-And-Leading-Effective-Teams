## Feedback Mechanisms
```
One of my favorite experiences in my last job was what we called one‑on‑ones. Perhaps your company already does these and you've known about them for years. They were new to me and I loved everything about them. One‑on‑ones were weekly meetings with my boss and sometimes my boss's boss. My boss was very personable and he made sure our meeting started out talking about me and what was going on in my life. It was kind of weird to have such a casual conversation, but the entire organization prided themselves on building a work environment where people loved to come to work and part of that was to develop real relationships with one another. Getting to know our coworkers was just part of the culture. In addition to talking about what was going on in my life, which might have been a one minute conversation, or it could have taken up all the time. We talked about business. We talked about projects, how things were going, ideas, suggestions, statuses, everything that was important to move our work forward. A friend's boss would watch TED Talks with her and then they would discuss the talk and how it could apply to either of them or their team. She found that very rewarding. They used this time for professional development, catered to my friends needs. One‑on‑ones are a great tactic to have a more unified environment, as well as ensure there are consistent and appropriate channels of communication. Have you ever tried meeting with your boss, but they were always too busy? One‑on‑ones is the exact opposite of that. Of course my boss was busy, but when it was one‑on‑one time it was just me and the boss. Traditionally, many organizations will have an annual review, sometimes called an annual performance review. Annual reviews can be a bit messy though. It's hard to talk about behavior or results from 11 months ago because either you have both forgotten about them or because they just aren't relevant anymore. So you tend to spend more time on the last, say six weeks. Not a great way to review performance and give input. Also, the purpose of this type of review is usually tied into some kind of raise or compensation adjustment. It's hard to have real conversations when one party is really hoping for a respectable increase in pay. There are other ways to ensure you and your team are giving the right feedback at the right times. A peer or manager recognition system where people on the team can get real feedback and praise from you and their peers can go a long ways to influence behavior, performance, and attitudes. As a manager, you want to make sure you have created a culture where people know they can bring ideas to you or the team and they will be heard and respected. This happens as everyone improves their active listening and presentation skills and people on your team respect one another. When your team culture has this kind of respect, you can talk about things to help each person improve. You can work on issues that come up, whether they have to do with work ethic or interpersonal issues. Your team feels you care about them more than just as a contributor, but really about their life and their career success. This starts with you putting the right elements into place where they are comfortable sharing and receiving the right feedback. When people know they are on track or that you're helping them get on track, they can perform with more confidence and your team will see the benefits of their efforts.
