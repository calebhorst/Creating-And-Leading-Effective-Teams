## Creating a Team Culture
```
One of the most important things you'll do as a team leader is create a team culture. If you don't create a team culture, you'll end up with a culture that might not be what you want. Everything we've talked about in this course so far are things that will help you create, impact, or reinforce your team culture. I strongly encourage you to intentionally create your culture instead of just letting it come together without any intention. How do you do this? With planning and consistency? Here are some steps on how to intentionally create a team culture. Define what you want your culture to look like. You write this down with as much detail as you can. You write this down to refer back to and even polish, as needed. You write it down so you can share it with others. The culture you want doesn't need to be a secret. Once you have this defined you can figure out a plan to work backwards from your definition. Optimize the right communication. I love reducing confusion, clarifying expectations, and having open communication where people feel like they have a voice and influence. Define what having the right communication within your team is and then work backwards from your definition to get there. For example, you might define the why, what, and how of meetings. Don't let meetings drift from their purpose or value. No one wants to have a meeting just to have a meeting. That can destroy an otherwise positive team culture. Create an environment where people know they can and should ask questions and even challenge ideas and processes. You create that environment when you express gratitude for their questions and ideas. A lot of people feel like they are risking perhaps their reputation or credibility when they ask questions. When they feel safe to voice their ideas or challenge things, you're more likely to get their best ideas. To create a culture of ingenuity, I allow people to fail and even celebrate their failure. In another course, I talked about the "Church of Fail", which I read about online. The article described a company that invited people to come together once a week and confess the failures they've had. They created a culture where failure was recognized and celebrated, letting everyone know it's okay to fail as long as they recover and learn from their failure. We all know, recognizing wins people have is critical, but don't hide or be ashamed of failure that we should learn from. A great tactic to learn from failure is a debrief, sometimes called a postmortem. People want to feel heard and understood. You can help them feel this way by asking questions and digging deeper into their ideas, instead of just assuming. In my course, Becoming a Better Listener, I talk about active listening, which is a phenomenal way to help people feel heard and understood. I like to help people who tend to be quiet have an opportunity to express themselves. I found sometimes there are brilliant people with brilliant ideas that never get heard because the louder people take up the conversation. You don't want to lose those ideas or that talent. Sometimes in meetings I'll say, "John what do you think about this?" That gives them an opening and perhaps permission to share their ideas without being talked over. If their personality is such that they won't share much, I might ask them one‑on‑one outside of a meeting or even in written format. Another component of the culture I like to create is having the right issues resolved right the first time. When talking about software projects for example, I work hard to have the right projects, problems, and issues listed in our ticketing system with the appropriate amount of details so my team can understand real problems and address the right issues. When talking about interpersonal issues, I want to address those as soon as possible so they don't grow out of control. As the team leader, you need to recognize these personal issues, validate feelings, and take care of your team members. When you take action quickly and thoroughly, you create a culture where people know you don't let issues get in the way of the purpose of the team. I like to create a culture where we focus on solving root problems instead of addressing things at a superficial level. Addressing root issues helps us do things right the first time, so we aren't burdened with a lot of unnecessary and distracting rework. One way to ensure our work is done right the first time is to follow up with affected parties, or our customers, to see if our solution was the right solution. Sometimes we think a project is done or a problem is resolved, but the people who are most impacted don't agree. These are some actionable, tactical things I do to intentionally create a team culture. I want. What will you do to intentionally create and influence your team culture?
