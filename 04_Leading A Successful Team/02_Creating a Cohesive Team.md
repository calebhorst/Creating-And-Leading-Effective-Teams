## Creating a Cohesive Team
```
Leading a successful team doesn't mean everyone is best friends, but it might mean you need a certain amount of respect for and the ability to work with one another. Don't mistake friendship and hanging out after hours with professional respect. I want people on my teams to work with one another well. I don't want to have to deal with arguments based on personality or likes or dislikes, but my team knows we welcome arguments based on best practices, what we should do, and how we do things. We're always looking for optimization and to get there we have to have conversations that sometimes feel intense. You can have intense conversations and still have a cohesive team environment. When your team members respect what each person brings to the team and appropriately stands up for one another, you are seeing the fruits of having built a cohesive team. So how do you get there? Here are some ideas. It is of utmost importance that you understand the team leader sets the example to create a cohesive team. This starts with you. You need to model respect, which is done in how you talk to and about each person on the team. Once you start dismissing one team member, you are opening the door for others to dismiss any team member. Recognition programs where you or another team member can highlight what someone has done can go a long way. This shows each person that work, ideas, and results are valued. I have learned from one of my favorite leaders that this is done consistently, maybe even daily. When the team leader models this, team members tend to recognize one another more frequently. Recognizing accomplishments and expressing appreciation is a great way to build cohesiveness. While your job isn't to make everyone friends with one another, you can certainly encourage people to get to know one another. Maybe in meetings, you set aside time to highlight a person or do an open question format where team members can ask questions of another person, encourage small talk, whether in your meetings, in the cafeteria, or even in the hallway. If your personality is like mine, watching people hang out and chat for a while can seem wasteful and you want them to get back to work, but don't squash it if it happens. The time we spend getting to know one another can do a lot for building trust in our teams. If you have the budget and the time consider external retreats or after hour get togethers. I was watching a team do a lot of offsites and wondering why in the world they were taking so much time to do them. As I watched the team come together, I realized those offsites contributed to them becoming a highly productive team. I think those offsites were opportunities to really focus on learning about and from each person on the team, creating a strong team culture, resulting in a high performing team. There are a lot of team building exercises you can find online or in books. They might seem goofy and well some of them are, but many can really help a team build cohesiveness. These don't have to be physical or too mental or even hard. Pick team building exercises that are right for your team makeup, considering the different personalities and needs of your team members. I am afraid of heights and would do really, really bad on a high ropes course. Respecting everyone's boundaries while still providing good unifying experiences is important. One of the most important things you can do as a team leader is to build a cohesive team where people can bring their best to the team. Don't focus on making sure everyone is friends with one another, but a team culture of respect will be critical to creating a cohesive feeling.
