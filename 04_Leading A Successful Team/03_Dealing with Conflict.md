## Dealing with Conflict
```
When you are in any leadership position, you'll have plenty of opportunities to deal with conflict. I am adverse to conflict and dealing with conflict doesn't come naturally to me. I know some people thrive in conflict and enjoy it. I'm not going to say I enjoy it, but I definitely like helping people work through it and get to a better place. As the team leader, you need to come to terms with resolving conflict. Here are six considerations to help you deal with conflict more effectively. First, make sure you exercise a high level of tact and diplomacy. As the manager, the boss, the leader, things you say can have a much different impact than if you are someone looking in from the outside. People look to you as an example of how to treat and talk about others. They're watching how you'll deal with situations and determine whether you are someone they can confide in, someone who will support them, and someone who they can take problems to. When you try to fix problems instead of fixing people, you'll earn respect as someone who is fair and who cares about problems and people. Dealing with conflict respectfully contributes to a culture of respect. Second, work hard to reduce any personal attacks. Conflict is usually accompanied by emotions and things can quickly get out of hand. When we attack other people and not actual problems, we focus on the wrong thing. Of course, people are usually at the heart of or involved with the problem, but resolving conflict is a lot easier when you focus on actions or behavior instead of someone's personality or something that is outside of someone's control or ability to change. Personal attacks exacerbate emotions and too many emotions can make conflict resolution feel impossible. Third, make sure you're working with the right people to resolve the conflict. If there's a conflict between two people, you generally don't have to put that in front of the entire team. Keep conflict where it needs to be. Communicating issues beyond who needs to be involved will add drama where it doesn't need to be and can be a major distraction to the rest of your team. Sometimes you'll have to involve people from outside of your team, like HR or another manager, but exercise confidentiality as you work with people to grow and change. The exception to this is that if the conflict has been an issue and others on the team know about it and it is impacting others, then either once you start to resolve it or once it is resolved, you can visit the issue with your team, but do it in a way that is respectful of all parties. Fourth, go into the conflict resolution with a spirit of mentoring. You want to help people work through the conflict so they can be a stronger team or at least in a good place to make progress on projects. As the team leader, you are in a position where you should help others become better and get back into a place to contribute to the team. When you go in with a spirit of mentoring, people feel appreciated and know you care about them even if there are difficult decisions you have to make that will impact them. Fifth, it's critical to document whatever is appropriate to document. What is appropriate will depend on the situation and your organization's policies. Consult with HR or your boss to figure out what you should document. I like to document more than less. So when I go back to my documentation, I have enough context and information to know what was going on, why decisions were made, what follow up needed to happen, etc. But you need to consult with your HR team because your documentation might end up in court and you'll want to make sure you have the right documentation. Sixth, timing is everything. When you first hear about a potential problem, you can either jump right in and figure out what's going on and try to fix it or you could gather more information to determine if you even need to get involved. Many professionals you work with will handle conflict on their own without your involvement. If you get involved too early, you could cause more problems or not let what might have been naturally resolved play out. However, hoping to not get involved and neglecting your role as team leader when something really needs your involvement is probably worse. Be aware of what is going on and try to get involved at an appropriate time. Instead of cringing when conflict comes up and ignoring it and hoping it will resolve itself, you can get really good at helping people work through conflict, and amazing things could happen.
