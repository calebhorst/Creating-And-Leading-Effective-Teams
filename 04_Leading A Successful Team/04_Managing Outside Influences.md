## Managing Outside Influences
```
Outside influences can have a big impact on your team. If someone outside your team talks about changes to your project or team before you have a chance to talk about them, expect a lot of questions from your team. For example, if a customer has access to your design or QA team and tries to exert authority over your team without going through proper channels, you could see a lot of scope creep. If an executive continually talks to your team and starts to manage or suggest changes without your involvement, your team might question their future or your future or authority. Here are some considerations to help you manage outside influences. First, if you're concerned about outside influences, it's critical your team understands the chain of command and how to get accurate information. Make sure everyone knows who the supervisors are on your team and who has good and accurate information. I'm a flat organization leader, meaning if you have a supervisor between me and you, you can always come talk to me and you know I'll be as open and honest as I can. Second, remember, one of your rules is to protect your team members. I've come out of meetings where I've been the team representative and had information that was irrelevant to my team. I share what needs to be shared and leave distractions like gossip and irrelevant speculation out. For example, let's say an executive questions are direction, but by the end of our meeting, she offers her full support. I may share the journey that executive went through to show how important we are to the organization, but I might not share the early part of her journey when she didn't value what our team was doing. That information would only be a distraction to my team. Third, part of protecting your team is to keep your emotions and feelings in check. If your team sees you panic or react inappropriately, you might see similar reactions from them. Or they might lose confidence in what you are doing and look at moving to another team that seems more stable. This is not to say you can't have feelings and emotions, of course you can. But just remember you have people who are looking to you to know what to think and how to react to outside influences. I've had team leaders who shared some information that shocked me, but judging by their calm reaction, I could tell my first impression was an overreaction and it was probably no big deal. I really looked to my team leaders to get confidence from them. Fourth, there is a tendency to hear things from customers, the media, or even industry leaders that are just not true but have a negative impact on your team. Your team will look to you as the team leader for truth. Be careful with your language so you can be a source of truth and trust. People should know, they want to know, that when they come to you they're getting the truth. Fifth, if you detect confusion and turmoil coming in from the outside, spend time with those outsiders who are causing the confusion and turmoil. Work to understand what is going on and what information is actually relevant to your team. You might need to share information or resolve issues, misunderstandings or conflicts with them, and then return back to your team with accurate and timely information. Outside influences can be a real distraction and can be the reason gossip and discontent seeps into your team. Handling outside influences is largely a part of really good communication, listening to and sharing information. Make sure you do your best to not let outside influences negatively impact your team.
