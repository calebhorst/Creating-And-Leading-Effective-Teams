## Managing Change
```
Every team I've worked on has seen change. Change can be really awesome or it can be confusing and distracting. When a competitor introduces a new product before your product is ready for market, you might see change in your specs or deadlines. When the economy is impacted by a recession, you might see changes in how people work, what they consume, or where they stop spending. Change can come from customers, your organization's executives, even other teams in your organization. Even good change can be frustrating, especially for people who are change averse. Because change is inevitable, you have an opportunity as the team leader to help your team through changes that will happen. As you learn change management skills, you will be in a stronger position as a leader and have a life skill that can help you for the rest of your life. I strongly encourage you to do a deep dive on change management. Kevin Miller and Alice Meredith, two excellent Pluralsight authors, have multiple courses on change management. Casey Ayers and Shelley Benhoff have courses on project management which talk about change management from a different perspective. I recommend diving into all of these courses because if anything will be constant in your career, it will be managing change. Here are some thoughts on helping your team through change. First, come to terms with the inevitability of change and help your team come to terms with this also. Just coming to terms with knowing that change will happen is important. They need to trust that change imposed on the team will be strategic and right, and not whimsical. Next you need to be an example of how to work through and even embrace the change that comes into your team. As you model how to react to changes, you normalize change. Not as some great disrupter that ruins everything, but as a variable to consider when working towards your objectives. If your team sees you panic or sees you react angrily to change, they will model that. They might lose confidence in you or whoever is imposing change. If they see you have a good understanding of how to act and react to change, they will have more confidence in you as a leader, the direction of your team, and their involvement and contributions. One of the things you can do to help your team navigate change well, is to focus on your team's objectives. When you focus on objectives, you can ignore some of the noise that comes from change, noise that really isn't relevant to your team or to a successful ending for your team. Now, if the changes impact your objectives, that's fine, make sure everyone understands what the impact is and what the new objectives are. Focusing on objectives is a great way to minimize the irrelevant impact of change that would otherwise be a distraction. Next, communicate appropriately. If the change is big or if the rumors are abundant, make sure you communicate well with your team so you can fight against the spread of bad information. This might mean a very clear email or meeting where you completely debunk bad information. It might mean you repeat that message multiple times. It might mean you talk to people one‑on‑one or talk to the main influencers on your team. People understand you might have a need‑to‑know information they aren't privy to, but they expect you to be as open with them as you can, and to always be honest. They deserve that from you and you owe it to them. Finally, every team leader has the responsibility to fight and advocate for their team when faced with change that should not happen. Of course, some change will come from places you can't impact, such as an economic crash or a company leader that makes massive decisions impacting the entire organization, not just your team. But some change is unreasonable and impacts your team in unforeseen ways. As team leader, determine if you should communicate with whatever powers you should to advocate for and protect your team. Perhaps people pushing the change don't understand the market opportunities or threats or the impact your team's success would have. You need to inform them so they can make the right decision and maybe undo the change they wanted to impose. Embracing change and becoming an expert in managing change will help you throughout the rest of your career. It will help you gain loyalty from your team members and confidence from your leaders. This is an excellent skill that you should really invest time into.
