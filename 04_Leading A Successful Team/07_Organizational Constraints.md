## Organizational Constraints
```
Every team I've worked with has had constraints imposed by the organization. Usually we see this in our budget, the number of people we can hire, and the tools and resources we get access to. We might see constraints in leadership's ability to help us, especially when leaders are overextended, don't understand the technical aspects of the project, or aren't bought into the benefits. It's easy to look at organizational constraints and think they must not be sure about our project or our team. But really, every department has constraints. One of your challenges is to optimize your team's output even though you have limited resources. Here are four things you can do when working with constraints. First, do an analysis to understand what your constraints are, what the impact of those constraints are, and why you have those constraints. Every organization, team, and project has constraints. This is just normal. Understanding exactly what your constraints are will help you set realistic expectations internally and externally. Second, communicate freely about your constraints, but not in a disparaging way. Make sure you also talk about your resources and the expectations of the team. I found when teams talk freely about these things, even when there is frustration, a new conversation can start. This new conversation might sound like, "What can we do now, since we aren't getting around these constraints? Jow can we meet our expectations?" This communication goes a long way to create a culture of trust. Similarly, communicating with people outside of your team can help them understand what you're up against and why you make certain decisions. Third, with your constraints defined and communicated, you might find you need to encourage your team to come up with creative and resourceful solutions. A manager should motivate, right? This is where you get to practice your motivational skills. I've seen creativity and innovation come out of nowhere when a team has to come up with new ideas to solve problems. Fourth, don't overlook opportunities to redefine or renegotiate deadlines, budget, or scope. In the project management and change management courses on Pluralsight, you'll hear about the quality triangle with time, scope, and cost at each point of the triangle. You can try to negotiate any of those points, but make sure you are clear that changing any point can impact other points. For example, you can deliver the project faster, but it might be more expensive, have less features than the original specs, and it might not go through your QA process as thoroughly as it would if you had more time. Negotiate and communicate the trade offs and you might find your constraints are lessened. As you work within your constraints, you'll help your team understand that even though you don't get everything you want, you can still work towards your objective.

## Notes
- Constraints are common in organizations, including budget limitations, resource availability, and leadership constraints.
- To optimize team output under constraints:
  1. Analyze and understand the specific constraints, their impact, and reasons behind them.
  2. Communicate openly about constraints without disparaging remarks, discussing resources and team expectations.
  3. Encourage the team to generate creative and resourceful solutions within the constraints.
  4. Explore opportunities to renegotiate deadlines, budgets, or scope, understanding the trade-offs involved.
- The quality triangle (time, scope, cost) illustrates that changing one point can affect the others, and negotiations should consider these trade-offs.
- Working within constraints helps the team understand that progress is still possible even when not all desires can be met.
