## Authority, Power, and Influence
```
Authority, power, and influence can sometimes be interchangeable, but they each have very unique characteristics. Here's how I think about it. Imagine you're driving down the road at night and you see police lights flashing behind you. I don't know about you, but that will make my stomach turn even if I know I wasn't speeding. So you pull over and the police officers approached the car. They ask for your documents. In the U.S., that's your license and registration and then they might give you a citation and tell you to be more careful. Or if you're lucky, they might just let you off with a warning. Typically a law abiding citizen will take the citation or the ticket and drive away cautiously. The police officer has authority to pull you over and give you a citation. That authority gives them power and the power and authority give them influence. What if someone impersonating an officer pulled you over? They do not have the authority to do that and if caught would be in serious trouble. But as long as they look like an officer, they still exercise power and influence to pull you over and probably make your stomach turn. They didn't have a right to, but they had power over you especially if they played the part well. Authority and power have intrigued me for a long time. Let's shift this to our team environment. Imagine a customer asks for a change order. The question is, do they have the authority to approve it? Maybe, maybe not. Depending on the contract, our customer might have authority to make changes or the contract might stipulate changes need to be approved by someone at a higher level. If you accept a change order by someone who doesn't have the authority, the customer could challenge the change, referencing the contract. Even though our contact might not have the authority to do certain things, they could have power and influence to impact our future relationship with the customer. If our contact loves us, we might win more business. If our contact hates us, they might advocate for a different service provider when the contract expires. So there you go, authority, power, and influence. Here are some considerations every team leader should think about. First, you should understand and even define what authority, power, and influence your team has, both as a team and every individual on your team. If your team is working on a high profile project, something even the board of directors, a high profile customer, or the media might be interested in, your team might have a lot of power. This can help you in bargaining for additional resources or whatever you need for a successful delivery. You might have people on your team that have a considerable amount of influence based on their network. You might have people who can leverage their power or authority in unique ways to contribute to the success of your team. Second, once you understand where authority, power, and influence lie, consider how this plays into other decisions you make. This might change who you assign as a customer liaison or who you have make presentations to executives. If someone on your team has special credibility in your organization or in the industry, consider putting them in front of your customers. Third, identify the authority, power, and influence you need from outside your team. Who are the external leaders or sponsors that can best help guarantee the success of your team? Who are gatekeepers and others that can have a significant impact on whether your team is successful or not? There are always external people who have authority, power, and influence you could tap into. Fourth, once you identify those people, forge relationships with them so you can tap into their authority, power, and influence. You might not need it right now, but it's better to start a relationship with them now and nurture that relationship so it's ready when you most need it than to approach them when you're desperate for their help. Understanding these dynamics can help your team be more successful.

- Authority is the right to take certain actions or make decisions based on a defined role or position.
- Power is the ability to affect or control others and situations, even without formal authority.
- Influence is the capacity to persuade or shape decisions and actions.
- In a team context, understanding these dynamics is crucial.
- Considerations for team leaders:
  1. Define the authority, power, and influence of the team and its members.
  2. Use this understanding to make informed decisions, like assigning customer liaisons or presenters.
  3. Identify external individuals with authority, power, and influence who can impact your team's success.
  4. Build relationships with these external individuals to tap into their resources when needed.
