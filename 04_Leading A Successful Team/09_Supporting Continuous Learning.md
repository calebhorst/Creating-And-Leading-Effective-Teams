## Supporting Continuous Learning
```
Employee motivation is a much studied and large topic. We could talk for hours about it, but I want to focus on one sliver of the topic that is relevant to this course. When talking about motivating others, there are two types of rewards. One is extrinsic, which basically means there is a cost associated, think bonus or raise. The other is intrinsic, which means there isn't a financial cost, like when your boss says thank you or that she appreciates your work. Showing appreciation is a motivating, intrinsic reward. Some studies say intrinsic rewards are more powerful than extrinsic rewards. This kind of baffles me because I'm always up for a big raise or bonus, but I have been the beneficiary of intrinsic rewards and know it changes how I feel about where I work. Continuous learning can be both intrinsic and extrinsic. An intrinsic example can be as simple as watching a short video as a team and then discussing it. Why is this a reward? Most people want to learn and grow, especially in tech. We want to feel like we're not getting stagnant. We want to have intellectual conversations and feel like our ideas are valued. When you carve out time from the normal schedule and bring people together, they can feel motivated and rewarded. An extrinsic example is to spend a few thousand dollars to send someone to a conference. I want to share four ideas of how you can use continuous learning to build the culture you want and lead your team to success. First, ask each person on your team what kind of continuous learning would be interesting to them. You might assume a developer wants training or courses on the language or technology they're working in, but there might be other skills that are bothering them and that they'd value more. Motivating your team with continuous learning will likely be more effective if each person is bought into what they're learning than if you give them something that feels irrelevant. Next, you need to be a model of continuous learning. At one company, I was in one of the leaders blocked out a significant amount of time on her calendar for her professional development. I don't know what she studied, but it was on her calendar. That showed me and the rest of us how important professional development was. When you take time to learn, or talk about what you have just read or learned, you give permission to others to talk about what they are learning next. You can explicitly recommend certain material, articles, blog posts, books, and courses. This gives them permission to spend time on their continuous education, as well as direction on what you think they should focus on. I know some team leaders have recommended certain courses I've done to their team members. Whether that was on creating better presentations or improving their listening skills. Sharing your honest feedback with your team can build a stronger professional relationship with them. Finally, have conversations around what people are learning. Whether you spend 15 minutes in a team meeting where everyone is in attendance or sponsor an optional lunch and learn, create opportunities to dive deeper into topics with one another, allowing them to share ideas, insight and experience, and teach and learn from one another, can be a really powerful learning experience. It can also be a great team building experience. The world, our careers, and industries feel like they are changing so fast. We all want to feel like we're keeping up and progressing along with those changes, providing learning opportunities can be one of the most impactful things you do as a team leader.
